Anagrams
==

Devise a function that gets one word as parameter and returns all the anagrams for it from the file wl.txt.

"Anagram": An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example orchestra can be rearranged into carthorse.

You can not use permutations to generate the possible words.

anagrams("horse") should return: ['heros', 'horse', 'shore']
